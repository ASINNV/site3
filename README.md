# _ELOQUENT CACOPHONY WRITE-UP_

## THOUGHTS

Third site went well. I definitely went into it thinking it would be easier than it was but it wasn't hard. I ended up having to restart the entire posts section but it was the best move. I have been known to get frustrated with confusion when I try to muscle through instead of just restarting and arranging perfectly as I go, no matter how slow it seems at the time, it's always faster in the end.

Once I restarted that section though, it went very smoothly. This time I took about a day and a half to complete the project. A lot of that time went to personal use and not work, however, so overall operation time was probably under 12 hours.

I can feel all this work improving the arrangement of knowledge, and the recall-ability of it, to the point where the css or html I need is instantly at the top, or close to it, of my mental queue. I feel it will be soon when I can code such simple pages as these with ease and efficiency and without having to think about it. 

## MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT

I'd say I ran into the most trouble with small things like aligning the post text with the date in an inline-block fashion. This was because I did not realize I had to set a width to shorten the text enough to fit side-by-side with the date element. A simple fix and hardly a problem that gave me all kinds of hell. 

## WHAT I LIKE MORE - DOC-WIDE SECTIONS OR SINGLE PAGE LONG CONTAINER

I'd say I don't have a preference yet. I did enjoy the structure of the page long container with all it's apparent visibility and tight form. On the other hand, sections aren't any more difficult or any less visibly satisfying and easy to use. They both have strength and I look forward to implementing the use of both.
